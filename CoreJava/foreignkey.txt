 create table customer1(
 cid int primary key,
 cname varchar(30),
 phno int);


 create table order1(
 oid int primary key,
 oname varchar(30) not null,
 cid int,
 foreign key(cid) references customer1(cid));


 customer1 is the parent table
 order1 is the child table.

customer1 table cid values are only allowed for cid
